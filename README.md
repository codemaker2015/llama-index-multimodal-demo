#  LlamaIndex Multi Modal Demo ðŸ¦™

LlamaIndex (GPT Index) is a data framework for your LLM application. LlamaIndex is a "data framework" to help you build LLM apps. It provides the following tools:

- Offers **data connectors** to ingest your existing data sources and data formats (APIs, PDFs, docs, SQL, etc.)
- Provides ways to **structure your data** (indices, graphs) so that this data can be easily used with LLMs.
- Provides an **advanced retrieval/query interface over your data**: Feed in any LLM input prompt, get back retrieved context and knowledge-augmented output.
- Allows easy integrations with your outer application framework (e.g. with LangChain, Flask, Docker, ChatGPT, anything else).

LlamaIndex provides tools for both beginner users and advanced users. Our high-level API allows beginner users to use LlamaIndex to ingest and query their data in
5 lines of code. Our lower-level APIs allow advanced users to customize and extend any module (data connectors, indices, retrievers, query engines, reranking modules),
to fit their needs.
